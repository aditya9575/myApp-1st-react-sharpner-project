first make some component and render it in app.jsx now if you need to have multiple different properties to be displayed in each of the 
base component rendering so we just pass these properties as a parameter in the app.jsx inside where we render those components 

And then -> we just go to that component and pass in props as function to it and dynamically do 
{props.title} 
{props.name} 
{props.car}

This is how it will work and the component will now render these properties as when we pass them on final component call in the app.jsx
